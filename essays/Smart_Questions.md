#What Is a Smart Question

   With the popularity of coding getting more and more popular every day, there will always be more questions asked every day, but how do we go into
asking these questions.  Asking smart questions help the person answering give a lot better answer than someone asking a very simple question.  How do we do this? We can start by checking to see if the question was already answered through the web, forums, books, or asking a peer in your class or work environment.  You also should make sure you are asking the right people for the job as well, you cannot ask a plumber how to fix your television. Also make sure that your questions are informative and precise, if you ask very bland questions you will just send messages back and forth when you could have just summed it all up in the initial question.  Also do not PUT YOUR MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS!!! because most likey you will be ignored.  You can ask by adding a "please" to be polite and make sure that your answer is precise and informs the person answering the situation that you are in, add all the information they need for the question to be answered quickly and show them that you have been working on it.  You should not just send code and say that it doesn't work, the answerer will probably not know what you are trying to accomplish with your code.

#A Good Example of a Smart Question

   This question that I have found from Stack Overflow which is a website where many questions about programming are asked every day.  The question was posted on September 11, 2024 and was answered the same day.  I am showing this question because I believe it is a great example on how good questions should be asked.

   In this example we can see that the questioner is walking through his process and shows what he is struggling with.  He also explains what he wants his program to do and shows what type of error message he was getting as well.

   You can see that the person that answered understood everything the person was struggling with through his explanation and was able to come up with the solution the same day without asking more questions.
   
#A Bad Example of a Smart Question

   This next question that I am showing is the wrong way on how to ask questions. 

  <img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/Screenshot 2024-09-12 214657.png">

   You can see that this person asking the question did not have a pretty good title.  It was very broad and does not really show what search engine he is talking about.  You should put a title that is informative and can really explain your problem.
   
## Conclusion

   In conclusion, asking smart questions is a lot more helpful when you are in a bind and it will help you and the person answering a lot better to 
figure out the problem you are having.  Also learning now about how to ask questions will help you further down in life to sound more professional, 
and will help you communicate a lot better in a working environment so that you could be more efficient and get things done quicker when projects come up.It helped me a lot learnning about asking smart questions and I will keep this in mind when I am having trouble in my coding and problems in the future.
