   Coding standards are the guidelines and rules on how developers should write code.  These guidelines are to be followed so that code can be more 
look more uniform and be able to be read by other developers better.  Coding standards consist of spacing and indentations and how the format of the 
code is, it also comprises of what types of variables to use in certain situations and the different types that should be used.  In class not only are
we being tested on our code, but we are now being tested on how are code follows these standards.
